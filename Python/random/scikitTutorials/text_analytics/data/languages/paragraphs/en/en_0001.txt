Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001, by Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger.[13] Sanger coined its name,[14][15] as a portmanteau of "wiki" (the Hawaiian word for "quick"[16]) and "encyclopedia". Initially an English-language encyclopedia, versions of Wikipedia in other languages were quickly developed. With at least 5,977,858 articles,[note 3] the English Wikipedia is the largest of the more than 290 Wikipedia encyclopedias. Overall, Wikipedia comprises more than 40 million articles in 301 different languages[17] and by February 2014 it had reached 18 billion page views and nearly 500 million unique visitors per month.[18]
