Wikipedians often have disputes regarding content, which may result in repeatedly making opposite changes to an article, known as "edit warring".[97][98] The process is a resource-consuming scenario where no useful knowledge is added.[99] This practice is also criticized as creating a competitive,[100] conflict based[101] editing culture associated with traditional masculine gender roles,[102] which contributes to the gender bias on Wikipedia.
