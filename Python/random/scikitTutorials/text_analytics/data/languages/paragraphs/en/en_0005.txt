The domains wikipedia.com and wikipedia.org were registered on January 12, 2001[37] and January 13, 2001[38] respectively, and Wikipedia was launched on January 15, 2001,[29] as a single English-language edition at www.wikipedia.com,[39] and announced by Sanger on the Nupedia mailing list.[33] Wikipedia's policy of "neutral point-of-view"[40] was codified in its first few months. Otherwise, there were relatively few rules initially and Wikipedia operated independently of Nupedia.[33] Originally, Bomis intended to make Wikipedia a business for profit.[41]
